# Hola! 👋 I'm Erika Dietrick, Developer Advocate @ Cisco. 
## Welcome to my Dojo 🐱📓✈️⚽🥔

After abandoning a promising writing career at age 8, disappointing my parents by saying no to med school, and learning to make a frappaccino very fast, I took a chance on programming, and I never turned back.

### My (Wholesome) Mottos 
* Anyone can learn with enough effort
* Programming should be fun, and I try to have a lot of it
* Programming is also frustrating, so let's be nice to each other
* Technology is here to serve people, not the other way around
* Tech trends will come and go, and we'll 
* Good documentation is *chef's kiss*
